# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      here is the bad example: 
      https://viz.wtf/post/187558414596/the-axis-choices-are-interesting-this-thing-is

      Why I pick this as bad example:
      Because it looks exactly the charts I made before with my spreadsheet, based on excel advised chart style. So I want to use this as a reflection to my previous understanding of data visualization.

      Why it is a bad example:
      Unclear Purpose:
      I will be confused on: Why the Canada Bar is shorter than Ontario. 
      Provenance Rhetoric: 
      even though it lists the source, but didn't tell me what the percentage rate is. Does it mean 30% of population in Ontario are immigrants?
      Poor Design Choices:
       The chart can carry out the information that Ontario has more immigrants and more "recent" immigrants than than Thunder Bay,which is common sense. 
      High Cognitive Load:
      There are 6 group of immigration periods,each represented in highly contrasting colors. This makes the chart look very complicated and requires significant cognitive effort to understand.
      Inappropriate Visualization Type: The data will be better presented with a pie chart.
       As I found a pie chart probably using the same data source but in a news here:
      https://www.cicnews.com/2017/10/immigrants-make-up-21-9-of-canadas-population-statscan-109735.html#gs.coys9i 
      The pie chart clearly illustrates the proportions of recent immigrants and older immigrants by grouping them into different immigration periods. The six groups use the same shade of color and also use text to highlight the number of immigrants in the most recent period is 1.2 million,accounting for 16.1%. so the audience can easily estimate the size of total population.
      
      However,pie chart can only show one metric of the data. More detailed information can be displayed in an interactive visualization, such as this one created with Tableau.
      https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicknguyen23/viz/AnalysisofImmigrantstoCanada/Dashboard1

      Why this is a good example:
      Tableau's interactive features enable users to select the year and explore trends. 
      The use of consistent colors ensures that the visualization is not distracting. 
      The dashboard includes maps, bar charts, and line charts to present different metrics of data in the most effective way. 
      In the map view, regions with larger populations are shown in darker colors and larger sized circle, drawing attention to the most important aspects of the data.
      Layout is well organized, and eliminated unnecessary data labels.
      Legends indicate the data series shown, simplifying the process of identifying and comparing them.


      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
    
      The colors in the bad example are used inconsistently, overwhelming the viewer. Using a consistent color scheme would make the chart simpler and clearer. Even with a uniform color shade, we can still draw attention to important parts by highlighting them effectively.

      Titles, axis labels, and legends of the bad example are either missing or unclear, making it hard to understand the data's meaning.While the good example: Relevant annotations and context are provided to help interpret the data.

      In the bad example, the designer aims to show the geographic distribution of immigration over different periods. Tableau's map function is an excellent tool for this purpose. The good example not only includes Thunder Bay but also visualizes immigration data for all major provinces, using circle size to represent the number of immigrants. We can enhance this by adding an interactive slicer, allowing users to filter the data for most recent periods/earlier periods and view the corresponding immigration data.










      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
