# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
        Your answer...
        
        Bad example-https://viz.wtf/image/187558414596
            Reproducible:
            The graph shows the exact data source.
            The bar chart is relatively easy to make.
            Equity:
            It is a 2D picture so everyone has equal access to it, and does not necessarily need to be embedded with a browser.
            Accessibility:
            The use of multiple colors and sharper contrast improves accessibility compared to the "good example". Additionally, the contrast is not excessively sharp, making it less likely to negatively affect 
            individuals with autism.
            There is no Alt-Text in the graph.
            The font size and type are readable, but it could benefit from larger font sizes for better readability.
            The labels and legends are clear, indicating the time periods for immigration data.
            
            Good example-https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicknguyen23/viz/AnalysisofImmigrantstoCanada/Dashboard1
            Reproducible:
            Based on tableauï¼Œbut didnâ€™t list the source of data. 
            The dashboard is kind of complicated to make as it requires coding the database support.
            Equity:
            It requires a browser and internet to have access to because it is embedded on the browser.
            It is easier to test the user feedback via the website.
             The dataset is not biased as it is history data.
            Font Size:Use a larger font size for better readability.
            
            Suggestion to good example:
            The whole dashboard is too big and the two colors used don't have enough contrast.So my suggestion is to enhance the contrast of the colors.
            Font Size:Use a larger font size for better readability.
            Add the data source for better reproducibility.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
